# Operators for Qiskit

## Overwiew

These operators integrates your quantum workloads on OpenShift. It provides a development environment to implement quantum algorithms and runs them either on IBM quantum computers or simulators.

## Getting started

1. Qiskit developer's experience operator
    
    Operator sets up a development environment with an integrated [Jupyter Notebook](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-azjvu4ak/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb) and pre-installed dependencies for running quantum circuits on [IBMQ Account](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).

    Example notebook implementing [Grover's Search Algorithm](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html)

    For getting started guides, installation, deployment and test Qiskit developer's experience operator follow [here](https://github.com/husky-parul/glowing-quantum/tree/qiskit-dev-op/operators-examples/qiskit-dev-operator).
